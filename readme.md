# scuffed_rust_adventofcode2024
an attempt at using rust to complete AOC2024 with zero prior rust experience

long story short: i started AOC like normal with java and then decided that would be too boring. the afternoon of dec 2nd i downloaded rust, popped open stackoverflow and the documentation, and rewrote my day 1 solution in rust.

i am not planning on doing any deep studying of how rust works, and many of the solutions will probably be held together by duct tape and elmers glue. that's somewhat the point though, brute forcing my way into getting started in rust. maybe i'll go back and clean up some solutions, but otherwise i'm leaving most of them as is.

TODO LIST:
- rewrite day 2 solution in rust
- look into how exactly variable ownership works so i dont have "oops! all .clone()s!"
